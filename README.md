🌱 Sustainable Agriculture – Crop Recommendation System
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Machine Learning-based Crop Recommendation System designed to help farmers and agricultural planners identify the most suitable crop to grow based on soil and environmental conditions.

By analyzing key factors like Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall, the model predicts the best crop for sustainable agriculture.

🎯 Objectives

To apply AI/ML techniques in agriculture for better productivity.

To recommend suitable crops based on soil nutrients & climatic conditions.

To visualize crop distribution, feature correlations, and model performance.

To create a lightweight, easy-to-run project without heavy dependencies.
